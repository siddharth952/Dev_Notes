What is REST?
    
    - Rules in place in server
    - Client <-> Server Req
    - Stateless Servers 
    - Uniform Interface : In REST everything that we are dealing with is a noun eg Books , Authors
    http://.../Books
    GET: Req data
    POST: Add Data
    DELETE: Remove
    PUT/PATCH: Patch specific part

    HATEOAS - Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State
        Each req, set of hyperlinks to navigate the API
