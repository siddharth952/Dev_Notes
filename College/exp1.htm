    Teaching Methodology
    The institute has a well qualified and experienced faculty. The most contemporary teaching methodology at MSIT provides ample opportunity for students to develop into all round professionals by keeping abreast of the ever changing technologies. The Institute aims to achieve and excel the high standards set by premiere technical institutions of the country. The traditional classroom teaching is supplemented by regular tests, tutorials, group discussions, extensive lab work, projects, seminars and industrial exposure by way of industry visits and summer training. Eminent academicians & professionals are invited as visting faculty to teach & guide specific courses. While teaching engineering fundamentals, keeping pace with the evolving definitions and concepts, a sincere effort is also made to cover the latest in each subject area.The classroom atmosphere is synergetic with interactive and participative sessions. This makes learning proactive and instills in the students a sense of team spirit, responsibility and professional integrity. It helps in building a healthy student-faculty bond, which develops students to their fullest potential and harnesses the best in the teachers.
